# Principle
Using two or more resistors to divide the voltage.

- V<sub>o</sub> = Voltage out for reading by device (like ADC).
- V<sub>i</sub> = Voltage input to circuit.
- R<sub>1</sub> = Resistor 1
- R<sub>2</sub> = Resistor 2

# Circuit
The voltage divider circuit is below:

# Usage Situation
1. Using to detecte R1/R2's voltage
2. Using to build operations depends on the voltage reading by ADC.

# Note
- Need to note the resistor cannot differ too much.
- If you got differ too much resistors,  
the divider will be useless.
