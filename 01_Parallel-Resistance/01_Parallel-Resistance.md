# Principle
Resistor connect in parallel.  

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{1}{R_T}%20=%20\sum_{i=1}^{n}%20\frac{1}{R_i}" alt="Parallel Resistance Formula">

- R<sub>T</sub> = Total Resistance
- R<sub>i</sub> = Each Resistance on the parallel circuit

# Circuit
The parallel resistance circuit is below:

And it is equal to:

# Usage Situation
1. The R1 is what your are using in circuit. 
2. R1 is very big so that the voltage is to low to detected.
3. You will need to use parallel resistance to reduce the resistance on this part of circuit.
