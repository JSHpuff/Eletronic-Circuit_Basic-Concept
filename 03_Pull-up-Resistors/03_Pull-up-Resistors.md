# Principle
- The pull-up resistors used logic circuits to ensure a high logical level.
- Pull-up resistors are used to solve the dilemma for the microcontroller by pulling the value to a logical high state.
- A typical pull-up resistor value is 4.7kÎ©.

# Circuit
The Pull-up Resistors circuit is below:

# Usage Situation
1. Used to ensure high logical level in the absence of an input signal.
2. Using to prevent float level in the pin.

# Note
- If not using any resistor(pull-up/pull-down),  
the logical level will be float.
