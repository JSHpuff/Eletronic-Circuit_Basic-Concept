# Principle
- The pull-down resistors used logic circuits to ensure a low logical level.
- Pull-down resistors are used to solve the dilemma for the microcontroller by pulling the value to a logical down state.
- A typical pull-down resistor value is 4.7kÎ©.

# Circuit
The Pull-down Resistors circuit is below:

# Usage Situation
1. Used to ensure low logical level in the absence of an input signal.
2. Using to prevent float level in the pin.

# Note
- If not using any resistor(pull-up/pull-down),  
the logical level will be float.
